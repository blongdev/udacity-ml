    "First, all characters will be converted lowercase. Usernames int the format @user and hashtags in the format #tag will be removed as these can often refer to a subject but do not a sentiment. Urls are removed as they may link to relevant information, but don't carry that information in url form. Repeated letters are reduced down to only repeating the letter twice so that words like \"hellooooo\" and \"hellllooooo\" would both map to \"helloo\". While this is not ideal, as they should map to \"hello\", some repeated letters are valid, such as the \"ll\" in \"hello\", so reducing all repeated characters to a single character would have its own problems. Punctuation that is used to break up a thought, such as a comma, period, or exclamation point, is replaced with a space since it is common to forget to add that space and simply removing it could combine the two words around it. Other punctution, such as an apostrophe, is simply removed to combine the letters in contractions rather than treating them as separate words, for example \"don't\" will be \"dont\" instead of \"don\" and \"t\". Finally all words with less than 3 characters are removed to get rid of filler words that dont add much to a sentence like \"as\" or \"of\". \n",
